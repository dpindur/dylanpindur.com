        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently employed as an application security consultant for HBF Health Insurance where I am responsible
            for developing and implementing an effective application security program. Previously I have enjoyed working 
            as a vulerable machine engineer for Offensive Security and as penetration tester and software developer for 
            The Commonwealth Bank of Australia. I like to build things which are secure with a focus on release automation 
            and Infrastructure as a Service.
        </p>
        <p>Outside of security and release automation I have a keen interest in web development and functional
            programming and enjoy talking at length on these topics. I gave a talk about 
            <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> at <a href="https://dddperth.com/">DDD Perth</a> in 2018.</p>

        <h2>Other Work</h2>
        <p>On the side a friend and I build and maintain a competency assessment application called
            Assessmate. Originally developed for the Murdoch University School of Veterinary and Life Sciences,
            Assessmate provides an easy-to-use solution for assessing the skills and capabilities of students.</p>
