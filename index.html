        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently employed as a security researcher for Assetnote where I get to search for new and interesting
            vulnerabilities in enterprise and open-source software. Previously I have enjoyed working at HBF Health Insurance
            where I headed up their Application Security program and at Offensive Security where I built vulnerable machines for
            the OSCP and Proving Grounds labs.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a keen interest in developer education as a primary software security control and would love to see more of an
            emphasis on defensive programming fundamentals as a security solution.

        <h2>Other Work</h2>
        <p>
            For a time, a friend and I built and maintained a competency assessment application called
            Assessmate. Originally developed for the Murdoch University School of Veterinary and Life Sciences,
            Assessmate provided an easy-to-use solution for assessing the skills and capabilities of students.
